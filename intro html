        <h1>Emanuel Chudy</h1>
        <p> I was born in Poland in December of 1998, came to the 
            United States with my family at the age of 8. I graduated High School
            In 2016. Went on to college witch I did not finish because I could not 
            find anything that I could major in that interested me and I wanted to 
            do for the rest of mylife. Since than I have been working in the Logistics 
            business and also driving trucks for FedEx. I recently came upon web development 
            thanks to one of my close friends that just finished his internship and got a job
            as a developer he explained it to me and it sounded like something I would enjoy 
            persuing as a career. On my free time I love to Travel stay outdoor and do physical 
            activities like snowboarding, wakeboarding, hiking, and camping.

            I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
            <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
            his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
            would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
